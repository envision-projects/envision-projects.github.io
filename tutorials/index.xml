1.1 Introduction:
PCB layout is a necessary part of electronics development. While breadboards and perfboards are fine for prototyping, fabrication and manufacturing for a production run require a fully functional and professional circuit board. There are several options regarding circuit design tools, but we will focus on three common ones: Eagle, KiCAD and Altium. While there are substantial differences between these programs, there are also many topics and practices that are ubiquitous across platforms.</description></item><item><title>Exporting Gerbers - Altium</title><link>/tutorials/exporting-gerbers-altium/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2022 03:19:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tutorials/exporting-gerbers-altium/</guid><description>Once we have a completed PCB layout, we need to order our PCBs. The fastest, cheapest, and most reliable manufacturing house we have found is JLC PCB It typically costs $2 for 5 PCBs, + around $22 for shipping, and they usually take around 5 - 7 days to arrive once ordered. That's quite a deal.
But how do we go from PCB design to the fabrication house? Each software is a little different.</description></item><item><title>Finite Element Analysis: SolidWorks</title><link>/tutorials/finite-element-analysis-solidworks/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 18:57:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tutorials/finite-element-analysis-solidworks/</guid><description>Finite Element Analysis: SolidWorks
1.1 Quick Introduction: Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool used by engineers to predict how parts and assemblies react to forces: heat, fluid flow, vibration, etc. Computer software such as SolidWorks, FEMAP, ANSYS, and Matlab use numerical analysis to create a general 3D mesh on the surface of the product and calculate stresses based on user-defined materials and forces.Â Note: Solidworks is not the most precise FEA software to use for engineering purposes, however, it is still accurate and is simple to use.</description></item><item><title>Motion Study: SolidWorks</title><link>/tutorials/solidworks-motion-study/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2022 18:31:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tutorials/solidworks-motion-study/</guid><description>Solidworks Motion Study
EnVision Maker Studio
1.1 Introduction: Motion studies are graphical simulations of motion for assembly models. You can use Solidworks mates in an assembly to restrict the motion of components in an assembly when you model motion. Motion studies in Solidworks do not change the properties of an assembly model. Instead, if changes are made to the assembly after the creation of the motion study, the software will automatically update the study and reveal any possible conflicts.</description></item></channel></rss>
