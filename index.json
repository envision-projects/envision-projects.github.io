We use 3 wires to wire the drone receiver to the Arduino Mega and wire up all the motors to the Adafruit Motor shield. Some basic soldering of the header pins onto the Motor Shield is required.\nCode Code is extremely basic and can be found in the omniwheelcar.ino file. The most important things are to install the I-Bus communcation library for the controller in order to get the joystick data.\nMaterials 1.5\u0026quot; [Omni Wheels](38mm (1.5 inches) Double Plastic Omni Wheel with 8 PU Rollers – The Smallest Omni Wheel – 14184 – Oz Robotics) DAGU Robot [Adafruit motor Driver Shield](Motor Stepper Servo Shield 1438 Adafruit Industries | Jameco) Arduino Mega FLYSKY Transmitter \u0026amp; Reciever M3 Lock Nuts M4 Grub Screws [M3 Hobby Park Bushings](Redcat Racing 02101 C-hub Bushings King Pin Bushings 12pcs 02101 609132454745 | eBay) Assorted M3 Bolts Getting Familiarized with MAE Terms Bushing ![[2022-07-24-19-43-36-bushing.gif]]\nFor spinning objects, it is good practice to use a bushing (Which is basically a cheap bearing) instead of simply spinning an object on a bolt. They are typically made of a low friction material like bronze.\n![[2022-07-24-19-45-35-image.png]]\nThrough Hole ![[2022-07-24-19-50-43-throughhole.gif]] Hole that is meant for a bolt to pass through without interference. I usually use a value = (OD of bolt)\u0026quot; + 1/32\u0026quot;\nTap Hole ![[2022-07-24-19-50-04-taphole.gif]]\nHole that is meant for a bolt to thread through it and essentially act like a nut (but without a nut, they're really convenient). It is important to understand that you can only use this with 3D Printing as the plastic will form it's own threads naturally. The pullout force is quite strong but it does not take much torque to strip the threads so you must be carefull of overtightening.\nI use a value of (OD of a bolt)\u0026quot; - 1/64\u0026quot;\nTolerance ![[2022-07-24-22-54-55-image.png]]\nAnything that we 3D Printing to fit around something \u0026quot;snuggly\u0026quot; must have a little bit of tolerance on it. If we make a hole exactly the size of the motor shaft, it will probably not fit and be WAAAY too tight, therefore we add a little bit extra called Tolerance.\nThere is quite an easy way to achieve this.\nCopy over the geometry of the Motor Shaft (MS). Click on all of the lines and select \u0026quot;Construction\u0026quot; (Or press q on keyboard to toggle) Click on the offset button and offset it by 1/128\u0026quot; This new line will be the Actual geometry that you use to fix the part around the motor shaft. (This value works for my 3D printeres but your results may vary) Gears Gear Types There are different types of gears that we can 3D Print! ![[2022-07-24-21-02-34-image.png]]\nSpur Gear (Left)\nHelical Gear (Middle)\nHerringbone Gear (Right)\nSpur Gear You are probably most used to the gear on the left, that's because they are easy to make and generally the least pain in the ass to use.\nSome disadvantages of them include that you have to constrain the gears in the axial direction. They can slide off each other unless you prevent that from happening with another part. They also make anonying noises because there is not a consistent mating between the two faces that happen.\nHelical Gears These fix the inconsistent mating problem with spur gears but because they are angled, they introduce their own problem of the gears themself wanting to push each other off of the axle. They create their own axial force lol. Cars use helical gears in their gearbox.\nHerringbone Gears They are the best gears because of their coolness. They are basically helical gears mirrored against each other to form a herringbone gears. The axial force formed by the angled teeth cancel each other, which therefore makes no axial load. Additionally, they are self-aligning, they will literally \u0026quot;snap\u0026quot; into place and hold themself from sliding off one another.\nYou probably have never seen these gears in the real world because they are really hard to produce and most of the time you can get away with just a spur gear. 3D printers are like the only machine that can produce herringbone gears so you better take advantage of these cool things.\nPitch diameter The Pitch Diameter tells the mating distance for the gear and is crucial when you're making a gearbox. Like how else would you know the distance to where you should put the other end of the shaft??\nLayout sketch ![[2022-07-24-21-00-45-image.png]] This will be the most important when making the Gearbox plate. This will allow us to let **CAD **find out the positions FOR US for all of our axles. In my layout sketch example:\nThe Pitch Diameters (PD) of both of the gears have a tangent relation to each other. I have drawn the wheel coaxially with it's respective gear to allow me to dimension how much ground clearance I want to have between the bottom of the Motor Pinion gear and the ground (Brown exclamation mark) CAD design Onshape File \u0026amp; Gear Setup Make a copy of Student copy of Onshape Files Open the file and click on the \u0026quot;+\u0026quot; button in the top-right corner to add a custom feature Under \u0026quot;public\u0026quot; search for \u0026quot;Advanced Gear\u0026quot; Add that featurescript to your toolbar Roadmap We will need to create 3 parts specifically in this order:\nMotor Pinion Gear Will have Gear Teeth and a form of coupler to the shaft of the motor Wheel Gear Have Gear Teeth and a form of coupler to the hub of the 1/5\u0026quot; Omni Wheel Needs to have 1/2 the number of Gear Teeth that the Motor Pinion Gear has Gearbox Plate This will hold attach the gear on the wheel to the chassis of the robot and most importantly will ensure a correct amount of spacing between the gears Creating the Motor Pinion Gear Creat new Part Studio Click on Advanced Gear in the top-right corner (The plugin you should've installed) On the window that pops up, change from \u0026quot;Module\u0026quot; to \u0026quot;Diametrical Pitch\u0026quot;![[2022-07-24-22-41-19-image.png]] Set the Number of gear teeth to 24 Set the Diametrical pitch to 25 Pitch Diameter = Number of Teeth / Diametrical Pitch Diametrical Pitch relates to the density and size of the gear teeth Change the type from \u0026quot;Spur\u0026quot; to Herringbone Set Pressure Angle to 30 ( Just some number that I found that works well for 3D Printing) Set Extrude Depth to 0.25\u0026quot; Hit the check box.
