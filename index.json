Common examples include smartwatches, home sensor arrays, Bluetooth headphones, even microwaves and refrigerators; they are nearly ubiquitous in modern technology.\nThis course will direct the student through the design and implementation processes for creating their own custom embedded system.\nEach certified student will be proficient in\nMicrocontroller programming - an overview of common APIs such as Arduino and VSCode as well as basic programming skills in C++ Sensor integration - an understanding of common sensors, how they operate, and how to use them in a program Communication protocols (I2C/SPI) - proficiency in inter-chip communication for fast information transfer between sensors and microcontrollers Analog and digital data acquisition (ADC/DAC) - an understanding of how microcontrollers process analog signals, including bit depth, sample rate and how these affect data acquisition ","link":"https://envision-projects.github.io/embedded/","section":"embedded","title":"Embedded Systems Certification"},{"body":"SolidWorks Software, 3D Printing, Post Processing, Laser Cutting, Enclosures and Assemblies, CNC Machine, Solid CAM, Motor/Servo Control, Finite Element Analysis\nMechanical Design and Prototyping will focus on the process through which moving machines are created and built. Beginning with ideation in CAD software, this certification will cover all parts of the process, from idea to product. Much of the material will concentrate on modern fabrication tools.\nEach certified student will be proficient in:\nCAD Software - a working knowledge of 2D and 3D design software including Adobe Illustrator and Solidworks 3D Printing - an understanding of different 3D printing techniques, slicing software, and the functionality of 3D printers in general Laser Cutting - something about laser cutting, probably.
