This is not for the faint of heart. This thing takes long and its hard to get right. Only for the advanced and over achievers.

About the Project This robot is a true creation of the idea many years ago brought on by Samy Kamkar's robot that &amp;quot;utilized&amp;quot; his algorithm for cracking these combination locks. The entire process works on the majority of locks that don't have much resistance on the dial and usually takes ~40 seconds.</description></item><item><title>Walking Robot</title><link>/mechanical/walking-robot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 19:16:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>/mechanical/walking-robot/</guid><description>W﻿alking linkage robots are very cool machines that simulate natural motion. However, they can be tedious to engineer as they often have many moving parts that must fit perfectly into the design. Often they go through many periods of trial and error before they are able to walk properly.
If you want to build one of these machines, it is crucial that you understand how the mechanisms operate and how to simulate them.</description></item><item><title>Obstacle Avoidance Robot</title><link>/mechanical/obstacle-avoidance-robot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 20:54:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>/mechanical/obstacle-avoidance-robot/</guid><description>By Blake Iwaisako
Description: Build a rover vehicle that drives straight until it encounters an object that it must detect and drive away from (Like a small Roomba!). This project can be made using a microcontroller of your choice, in this example I will use an Arduino Uno combined with an Adafruit motor shield. This document will also be covering the basics of ultrasonic sensors as it is used for detecting objects within a specified distance.</description></item><item><title>Omni Car Project</title><link>/mechanical/omni-car-project/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 00:15:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>/mechanical/omni-car-project/</guid><description>About Omni Car Project By: MingWei Yeoh
It's a tank driven car with omni wheels for some sick drifting without the fear of shredding the floor! Combined with a responsive FLYSKY Drone Transmitter, this makes for a fun project!
Challenges CAD The main gripe with the included motors in the kit is that they are a little slow. Thus we will be making a custom 1:2 speed gearbox with OnShape in order to speed up the drive wheels!</description></item></channel></rss>
