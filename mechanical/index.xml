You will be required to:
Design a working chassis to house all electronic components in SolidWorks. Manufacture and/or source all parts needed (nuts, bolts, motors, microcontrollers, etc.). Create a Motion Study in SolidWorks that theoretically proves your design will work as intended. Assemble the robot and write code to make it run. Brief on 4-bar Linkages 4-bar linkages are a very common mechanism used in mechanical engineering that consists of four rods connected by pins.</description></item><item><title>Obstacle Avoidance Robot</title><link>/mechanical/obstacle-avoidance-robot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 20:54:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>/mechanical/obstacle-avoidance-robot/</guid><description>EnVision Maker Studio
Description: Build a rover vehicle that drives straight until it encounters an object that it must detect and drive away from (Like a small Roomba!). This project can be made using a microcontroller of your choice, in this example I will use an Arduino Uno combined with an Adafruit motor shield. This document will also be covering the basics of ultrasonic sensors as it is used for detecting objects within a specified distance.</description></item><item><title>3D Printing</title><link>/mechanical/3d-printing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 00:15:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>/mechanical/3d-printing/</guid><description>Click me!</description></item><item><title>Omni Car Project</title><link>/mechanical/omni-car-project/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 00:15:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>/mechanical/omni-car-project/</guid><description>About Omni Car Project By: MingWei Yeoh
It's a tank driven car with omni wheels for some sick drifting without the fear of shredding the floor! Combined with a responsive FLYSKY Drone Transmitter, this makes for a fun project!
Challenges CAD The main gripe with the included motors in the kit is that they are a little slow. Thus we will be making a custom 1:2 speed gearbox with OnShape in order to speed up the drive wheels!</description></item></channel></rss>
