Physical circuits on a board are first built on paper in the form of a schematic diagram. Circuit design typically begins with a schematic, where components are chosen, nets are created, and the flow of signals determined. The PCB is then created by using the schematic as its primary reference. Building the PCB from the schematic and working with the two in tandem not only simplifies PCB layout, but also allows for better error checking, component selection, and overall workflow.</description></item><item><title>PCB Layout</title><link>/electrical/pcb-layout/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 01:59:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>/electrical/pcb-layout/</guid><description>PCB Layout:
1.1 Introduction:
PCB layout is a necessary part of electronics development. While breadboards and perfboards are fine for prototyping, fabrication and manufacturing for a production run require a fully functional and professional circuit board. There are several options regarding circuit design tools, but we will focus on three common ones: Eagle, KiCAD and Altium. While there are substantial differences between these programs, there are also many topics and practices that are ubiquitous across platforms.</description></item><item><title>wipers</title><link>/electrical/wipers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 18:30:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>/electrical/wipers/</guid><description>test CMS</description></item><item><title>Pcb Design with KiCAD</title><link>/electrical/pcb-design-with-kicad/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 18:15:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>/electrical/pcb-design-with-kicad/</guid><description>Test netlifyCMS
