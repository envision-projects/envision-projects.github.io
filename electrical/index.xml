Slip rings are devices that allow electrical contacts through rotating bodies.
Usually you would simply buy a slip ring, so the question remains, why reinvent the slip ring if it already exists?
My excuse was that they're expensive. Most especially ones with a through hole in the center :( Slip rings are a good way to practice PCB and CAD design.</description></item></channel></rss>
