1.1 Introduction:
PCB layout is a necessary part of electronics development. While breadboards and perfboards are fine for prototyping, fabrication and manufacturing for a production run require a fully functional and professional circuit board. There are several options regarding circuit design tools, but we will focus on three common ones: Eagle, KiCAD and Altium. While there are substantial differences between these programs, there are also many topics and practices that are ubiquitous across platforms.</description></item><item><title>SolidWorks Motion Study</title><link>/tutorials/solidworks-motion-study/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2022 18:31:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tutorials/solidworks-motion-study/</guid><description>1.1 Introduction: Motion studies are graphical simulations of motion for assembly models. You can use Solidworks mates in an assembly to restrict the motion of components in an assembly when you model motion. Motion studies in Solidworks do not change the properties of an assembly model. Instead, if changes are made to the assembly after the creation of the motion study, the software will automatically update the study and reveal any possible conflicts.</description></item><item><title>New Doc</title><link>/mechanical/new-doc/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2022 18:26:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>/mechanical/new-doc/</guid><description>haskjlhflkhasfkavoirbvudrbvubv

By: MingWei Yeoh
![[2022-07-23-12-29-43-robotcar.gif]] It's a tank driven car with omni wheels for some sick drifting without the fear of shredding the floor! Combined with a responsive FLYSKY Drone Transmitter, this makes for a fun project!
Challenges CAD The main gripe with the included motors in the kit is that they are a little slow. Thus we will be making a custom 1:2 speed gearbox with OnShape in order to speed up the drive wheels!</description></item><item><title>PCB Slip Ring Project</title><link>/electrical/baby-slip-ring/documentation/instructions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 00:15:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>/electrical/baby-slip-ring/documentation/instructions/</guid><description>About the Project We will be creating a pcb slip ring that lights up 2 LED lights with a USB C Connector!
Slip rings are devices that allow electrical contacts through rotating bodies. ![[slipring.gif|350]]
![[cadslipring.gif]] Usually you would buy things like this, so the question remains, why reinvent the slip ring if it already exists?
My excuse was that they're expensive. Over 200$ if you need one with a through hole in the center :(</description></item><item><title>Search</title><link>/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/search/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
