You will be required to:
Design a working chassis to house all electronic components in SolidWorks. Manufacture and/or source all parts needed (nuts, bolts, motors, microcontrollers, etc.). Create a Motion Study in SolidWorks that theoretically proves your design will work as intended. Assemble the robot and write code to make it run. Design a Chassis You can design this robot with one or two continuous rotation motors.</description></item><item><title>SimpleSynth Project</title><link>/embedded/simplesynth-project/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 03:10:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>/embedded/simplesynth-project/</guid><description>The SimpleSynth is a Teensy-based audio synthesizer. We will be building an expansion board for the Teensy, as well as an enclosure for the boards and controls (switches, buttons, potentiometers, etc…) and then programming the synthesizer using the Arduino IDE and the Audio System Design Tool for the Teensy Audio Library. While the final product represented here is fully functional, it is also very expandable, and users are encouraged to explore ways of doing so by adding various effects, controls, displays, etc…</description></item><item><title>Soldering</title><link>/tutorials/soldering/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 22:50:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tutorials/soldering/</guid><description>Generic Online Tutorial

Physical circuits on a board are first built on paper in the form of a schematic diagram. Circuit design typically begins with a schematic, where components are chosen, nets are created, and the flow of signals determined. The PCB is then created by using the schematic as its primary reference. Building the PCB from the schematic and working with the two in tandem not only simplifies PCB layout, but also allows for better error checking, component selection, and overall workflow.</description></item><item><title>Obstacle Avoidance Robot</title><link>/mechanical/obstacle-avoidance-robot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 20:54:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>/mechanical/obstacle-avoidance-robot/</guid><description>EnVision Maker Studio
Description: Build a rover vehicle that drives straight until it encounters an object that it must detect and drive away from (Like a small Roomba!). This project can be made using a microcontroller of your choice, in this example I will use an Arduino Uno combined with an Adafruit motor shield. This document will also be covering the basics of ultrasonic sensors as it is used for detecting objects within a specified distance.</description></item><item><title>Finite Element Analysis: SolidWorks</title><link>/tutorials/finite-element-analysis-solidworks/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 18:57:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tutorials/finite-element-analysis-solidworks/</guid><description>Finite Element Analysis: SolidWorks
1.1 Quick Introduction: Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool used by engineers to predict how parts and assemblies react to forces: heat, fluid flow, vibration, etc. Computer software such as SolidWorks, FEMAP, ANSYS, and Matlab use numerical analysis to create a general 3D mesh on the surface of the product and calculate stresses based on user-defined materials and forces. Note: Solidworks is not the most precise FEA software to use for engineering purposes, however, it is still accurate and is simple to use.</description></item><item><title>PCB Layout</title><link>/electrical/pcb-layout/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 01:59:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>/electrical/pcb-layout/</guid><description>PCB Layout:
1.1 Introduction:
PCB layout is a necessary part of electronics development. While breadboards and perfboards are fine for prototyping, fabrication and manufacturing for a production run require a fully functional and professional circuit board. There are several options regarding circuit design tools, but we will focus on three common ones: Eagle, KiCAD and Altium. While there are substantial differences between these programs, there are also many topics and practices that are ubiquitous across platforms.</description></item><item><title>Motion Study: SolidWorks</title><link>/tutorials/solidworks-motion-study/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2022 18:31:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tutorials/solidworks-motion-study/</guid><description>Solidworks Motion Study
EnVision Maker Studio
1.1 Introduction: Motion studies are graphical simulations of motion for assembly models. You can use Solidworks mates in an assembly to restrict the motion of components in an assembly when you model motion. Motion studies in Solidworks do not change the properties of an assembly model. Instead, if changes are made to the assembly after the creation of the motion study, the software will automatically update the study and reveal any possible conflicts.</description></item><item><title>wipers</title><link>/electrical/wipers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 18:30:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>/electrical/wipers/</guid><description>test CMS</description></item><item><title>Pcb Design with KiCAD</title><link>/electrical/pcb-design-with-kicad/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 18:15:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>/electrical/pcb-design-with-kicad/</guid><description>Test netlifyCMS

It's a tank driven car with omni wheels for some sick drifting without the fear of shredding the floor! Combined with a responsive FLYSKY Drone Transmitter, this makes for a fun project!
Challenges CAD The main gripe with the included motors in the kit is that they are a little slow. Thus we will be making a custom 1:2 speed gearbox with OnShape in order to speed up the drive wheels!</description></item><item><title>PCB Slip Ring Project</title><link>/electrical/baby-slip-ring/documentation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 00:15:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>/electrical/baby-slip-ring/documentation/</guid><description>About the Project We will be creating a pcb slip ring that lights up 2 LED lights with a USB C Connector!
Slip rings are devices that allow electrical contacts through rotating bodies. ![[slipring.gif|350]]
![[cadslipring.gif]] Usually you would simply buy a slip ring, so the question remains, why reinvent the slip ring if it already exists?
My excuse was that they're expensive. Most especially ones with a through hole in the center :( !</description></item><item><title>Search</title><link>/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/search/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
