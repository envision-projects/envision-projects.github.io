description: Embedded Systems Overview
---
Embedded Systems are combinations of hardware and software that are built for a specific purpose in mind, as opposed to personal computers which are more general use. Common examples include smart watches, home sensor arrays, Bluetooth headphones, even microwaves and refrigerators; they are nearly ubiquitous in modern technology. 

This course will direct the student through the design and implementation process for creating their own custom embedded system.
