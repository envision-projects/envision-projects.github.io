description: Embedded Systems Overview
---
Embedded Systems are combinations of hardware and software that are built for a specific purpose in mind, as opposed to personal computers which are more general use. Common examples include smart watches, home sensor arrays, Bluetooth headphones, even microwaves and refrigerators; they are nearly ubiquitous in modern technology. 

This course will direct the student through the design and implementation process for creating their own custom embedded system. 

Each certified student will be proficient in 

* Microcontroller programming - an overview of common APIs such as Arduino and VSCode as well as basic programming skills in C++
* Sensor integration - an understanding of common sensors, how they operate, and how to use them in a program
* Communication protocols (I2C/SPI) - proficiency in inter-chip communication for fast information transfer between sensors and microcontrollers
* Analog and digital data acquisition (ADC/DAC) - an understanding of how microcontrollers process analog signals, including bit depth, sample rate and how these affect data acquisition
