## Details

T﻿he CurtainMote uses a WiFi web server hosted on an ESP32 microcontroller that connects to your home WiFi. The curtain-pulling mechanism uses a nearly invisible fishing line that runs along the length of the curtain rod in both directions, refer to the gif below:

T﻿his requires the use of a motor to pull the string forward and backward thus opening and closing your curtains.
