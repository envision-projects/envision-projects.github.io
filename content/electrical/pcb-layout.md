PCB Layout:

1.1 Introduction:

PCB layout is a necessary part of electronics development. While breadboards and perfboards are fine for prototyping, fabrication and manufacturing for a production run require a fully functional and professional circuit board. There are several options regarding circuit design tools, but we will focus on three common ones: Eagle, KiCAD and Altium. While there are substantial differences between these programs, there are also many topics and practices that are ubiquitous across platforms. 

1.2 Key Terms:
