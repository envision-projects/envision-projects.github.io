The EnVision Hands-on Prototyping, Fabrication and Manufacturing Certificate program is way to formally recognize the advanced work that many students do in the EnVision Arts and Engineering Maker Studio. Aimed towards those students who wish to pursue proficiency beyond what is covered in most classes, the purpose of the certificate program is:

1. To present advanced training on the tools, equipment and resources in the EnVision Maker Studio
2. To formally recognize the work that students do in EnVision
3. To expose students to, and provide them with training on tools they may not encounter or have access to through classroom instruction
4. To incentivize students to continue their engagement with hands-on education beyond the classroom

The ***HOPFAM*** certification program is entirely project-based. Students may choose one of four focus areas:

* ***Electrical Design* -** PCB Design, Schematics, Altium/Eagle/KiCAD, Component Sourcing, Advanced Soldering
* ***Mechanical Design -*** Solidworks/Fusion360, Advanced 3D Printing, Laser Cutting, CNC, Motor/Servo control
* ***Embedded Systems -***  Development Boards, Microcontrollers, Sensor Interaction, HCI, Basic Python/C++ Programming
* ***Craft -***  Woodworking, Joinery, Sewing, Industrial Shop Tools, Inlays, and Advanced Construction

Each focus area has 1st and 2nd tier proficiencies. Final projects must represent all 1st tier proficiencies and at least two 2nd tier proficiencies. Students may present their own project ideas for consideration, or choose from existing projects that they may build upon.

Instruction for each course is self-directed and at any pace. It is generally assumed that each course/project will take around 80 hours to complete and be done over the course of one or two quarters. One-on-one instruction is available for any student upon request for any portion(s) of the course. This website is the primary instructional tool, however, as it provides step-by-step instructions, useful links, files, and more.
