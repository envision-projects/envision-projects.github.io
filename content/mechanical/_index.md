Mechanical Design and Prototyping will focus on the process through which moving machines are designed and built. Beginning with ideation in CAD software, this certification will cover all parts of the process, from idea to product. Much of the material will concentrate on modern fabrication tools that allow for the creation of precision-made parts. Projects will consist of complex and moving machines that are unique and/or customized.
