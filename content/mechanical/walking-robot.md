For this project you will design a robot that walks around using a 4-bar linkage for legs! You will be required to:

1. Design a working chassis to house all electronic components in SolidWorks.
2. Manufacture and/or source all parts needed (nuts, bolts, motors, microcontrollers, etc.).
3. Create a Motion Study in SolidWorks that theoretically proves your design will work as intended.
4. Assemble the robot and write code to make it run.

## Design a Chassis

You can design this robot with one or two continuous rotation motors. In this tutorial we will be following a robot that has two high torque continuous rotation servo motors. 

Without dimensions, here is an example of a working chassis:

**This chassis does not show how to mount the microcontroller or the battery, that will be up to you to design!**
