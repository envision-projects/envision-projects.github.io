For this project you will design a robot that walks around using a 4-bar linkage for legs! You will be required to:

1. Design a working chassis to house all electronic components in SolidWorks.
2. Manufacture and/or source all parts needed (nuts, bolts, motors, microcontrollers, etc.).
3. Create a Motion Study in SolidWorks that theoretically proves your design will work as intended.
4. Assemble the robot and write code to make it run.
