## **Description:**

Build a rover vehicle that drives straight until it encounters an object that it must detect and drive away from (Like a small roomba!). This project can be made using a microcontroller of your choice, in this example I will use an adruino uno combined with an adafruit motor shield. This document will also be covering the basics of ultrasonic sensors as it is used for detecting objects within a specified distance.Â 



## **Designing the chassis in SolidWorks:**

Depending on the type of drive system you want (2-wheel or 4 wheel drive), create a new SolidWorks part that will house you motor, microservo, Arduino Uno, Adafruit Motor Shield, and battery pack.
