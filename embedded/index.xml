For this demonstration we will be using the ESP32 Wrover Module shown here:
Installing the ESP32 Library on Arduino IDE Follow this step-by-step guide to install the ESP32 library. You only need to install the library as the rest of the tutorial goes about testing the ESP32's WiFi capabilities, however, feel free to try this out.</description></item><item><title>SimpleSynth Project</title><link>/embedded/simplesynth-project/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 03:10:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>/embedded/simplesynth-project/</guid><description>The SimpleSynth is a Teensy-based audio synthesizer. We will be building an expansion board for the Teensy, as well as an enclosure for the boards and controls (switches, buttons, potentiometers, etc…) and then programming the synthesizer using the Arduino IDE and the Audio System Design Tool for the Teensy Audio Library. While the final product represented here is fully functional, it is also very expandable, and users are encouraged to explore ways of doing so by adding various effects, controls, displays, etc…</description></item></channel></rss>
