This can give you full control of the microcontroller regardless of where you are as long as you and the microcontroller are connected to the internet.

Whenever a person or object is detected (when the IR beam is broken) the instance will be logged on the ESP32 alongside the time the instance took place. The ESP32 will also be capable of sending you emails whenever a beam break occurs or after a certain period of time. By connecting to the server via IP address, a second party can see the full log of instances recorded In this project, we will learn how to use IR beam break sensors, create a webserver using the ESP32, attain the current time from an NTP server, and send email notifications using SMTP.</description></item><item><title>SimpleSynth Project</title><link>/embedded/simplesynth-project/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 03:10:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>/embedded/simplesynth-project/</guid><description>The SimpleSynth is a Teensy-based audio synthesizer. We will be building an expansion board for the Teensy, as well as an enclosure for the boards and controls (switches, buttons, potentiometers, etc…) and then programming the synthesizer using the Arduino IDE and the Audio System Design Tool for the Teensy Audio Library. While the final product represented here is fully functional, it is also very expandable, and users are encouraged to explore ways of doing so by adding various effects, controls, displays, etc…</description></item></channel></rss>
